**Introduction :** In the last decade, the scientific research community has witnessed an exponential surge in the usage of two technologies, namely artificial intelligence, abbreviated as AI, and machine learning, abbreviated as ML. These modern methods, mostly involving mathematical algorithms and procedures which train on existing data and via analysis, produce insights and findings which aid the scientists in innovating new materials as well as other theories as well. 

**Material Science Research :** Material Science is one of the oldest forms of applied science and throughout the ages, has played an integral role in various fields. It involves research about the properties of matter and then combining different elements or compounds to produce materials which have the necessary attributes to perform a specific role as a component in various other entities. Material science forms the backbone of many other disciplines of engineering and is one of the most important branches of applied sciences from an industrial perspective. 

**Role of AI and ML in research :** AI and ML algorithms have the special ability to train on huge datasets and generate useful insights and never-seen-before patterns, relations, and properties that often propel research in the right direction. In a discipline like the material sciences, where a lot of properties and their interactions in combination need to be analysed in order to synthesise newer materials and predict their properties, AI and ML can accelerate the existing endeavours that shall help in the advancement by leaps and bounds. 

**How AI and ML is used in existing materials research :** Material science involves techniques like the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) which are simulations of quantum systems. With years of study and experimentation on the conventional methods of property prediction, such as the empirical trial-error method, and density functional theory (DFT), researchers have collected huge data in the field of material science. ML algorithms have been used in crystal structure prediction, energy materials, perovskite synthesis for photovoltaic cells, and drug discovery among other uses. For example, the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) images have been used in convolutional neural networks (JARVIS-STMNet) to classify the structure of Bravais Lattices.

**How AI and ML can be incorporated further :** Using AI and ML, we can carefully curate datasets which contain specific trends in property and how the properties of a particular material changes due to the addition or removal of another element to it. The different behavioural patterns exhibited by existing materials, alongside correlation with their composition, shall form a dataset that should be able to train the AI models in identifying the exact amount of specific elements whose addition or removal shall constitute a material with desired traits. 

For example, a machine can be constructed which shall have at its disposal requisite amounts of the building block elements which we use today to construct materials. A list of properties, such as ductility, tensile strength, heat resistance when provided to the machine, it should be able to think based on the existing data set in its memory and use the algorithm to decide what the composition of the material should be. Such a machine, even if it performs at a capacity below what has been stated above, shall aid the scientists in a positive manner and point them in the right direction so as to what steps must be taken.

**Novel Steps to accelerate AI and ML :** Modern AI and ML has received a huge boost in the form of hardware acceleration. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) have led to the rise of superfast computing devices which have raised the bar as far as feasibility of resource-intensive algorithms are concerned. 

More complex simulations, even those at the molecular level, can be run smoothly on these devices to provide better results. There are several ways in which technology can help in better AI and ML algorithms. Here are some of them:

- **Boosting Algorithms:** Boosting algorithms prioritise features that increase predictive accuracy during training. They can help to reduce data attributes and handle large datasets.

- **Feed More Data:** Expanding the dataset is one of many ways to improve AI. Feeding more data into the model can help improve its accuracy.

- Improve the Data: Enriching the data by improving the annotation of the existing dataset or using new and improved labelling techniques can also help in improving the accuracy of AI/ML models.

- **Improve the Algorithm:** Improving the quality of the algorithm is also necessary for improving AI/ML models. Using a data-centric approach can also help in improving the development process of AI.

- **Sharpen Predictions:** AI can help businesses sharpen predictions, boost efficiencies, and optimise the real-time pricing or stock control of their products. Companies that push the boundaries of AI to achieve these goals are moving faster and further than rivals still conservatively wavering over the wisdom of using AI for these purposes.

- **Increase Productivity:** AI is helping businesses boost productivity in many ways. For example, AI can improve customer service decision speed and consistency, reduce customer waiting time, and detect potential frauds.

Overall, technology can help in better AI and ML algorithms by improving the accuracy of predictions, reducing errors, and increasing productivity.

**Conclusion :** We can see that AI and ML is akin to the Philosopherâ€™s Stone for material science research. While the ingenuity of human researchers are unparalleled and irreplaceable, the potent combination of the human brain along with intelligent algorithms running on super fast computing machines shall pave the glorious path on our search for superior materials which shall be better than the existing ones in all parameters and shall also be economically feasible.
